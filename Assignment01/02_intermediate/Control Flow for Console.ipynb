    "Two numbers are generated from 1 to 100 (inclusive on both ends): one for you and one for a computer, who will be your opponent. You can see your number, but not the computer's!\n",

    "If your guess matches the truth (ex. you guess your number is higher, and then your number is actually higher than the computer's), you get a point!\n",
